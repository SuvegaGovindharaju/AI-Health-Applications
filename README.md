AI in the Metaverse for Patient Diagnostics


---

📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid advancement of virtual environments and immersive technologies, there's a growing need to simulate healthcare interactions in the **Metaverse**. Patients should be able to interact with AI-based diagnostic systems in virtual clinics, even without access to real doctors. This project aims to **simulate such AI behavior for patient diagnostics in the Metaverse** using a simple rule-based system.

📖 Description

This Python program mimics a virtual health assistant in the Metaverse. When a user (patient) enters symptoms, the AI system matches them with known conditions and provides a possible diagnosis. The user is then guided to a simulated **virtual consultation room** for further follow-up.

Key features:
- Patient inputs name, age, and symptoms.
- AI matches symptoms using rule-based logic.
- Generates and displays a diagnostic report.
- Assigns a virtual room number as if inside the Metaverse.

🛠️ Technology

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `time` (for realistic pauses)
  - `random` (to generate virtual room numbers)
